Based on the diagram and the provided information, hereâ€™s how the ownership of assets and cloud-native services can be described, depending on the category of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

Ownership of Assets Based on Cloud Service Category:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):

Ownership: The assets (infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networking, and storage) belong to the organization.
Description: The organization has more control over the infrastructure, managing servers, storage, and networks. The cloud provider offers the foundational services like compute, storage, and networking, but the organization is responsible for managing these resources at the operating system and application level.
Cloud Service Example: Google Cloud Compute Engine (Virtual Machines), Google Cloud Storage, Virtual Networks.
PaaS (Platform as a Service):

Ownership: The application assets belong to the organization; however, the underlying infrastructure (compute, networking, and storage) is managed by the cloud service provider.
Description: The organization can focus on application development while the cloud provider manages the platform, including scaling, updates, and patching. PaaS abstracts the management of the underlying infrastructure and provides a ready-to-use environment for development and deployment.
Cloud Service Example: Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Dataflow (for data processing pipelines).
SaaS (Software as a Service):

Ownership: The cloud service provider owns and manages the application and its underlying infrastructure.
Description: The organization uses the software without needing to manage the infrastructure or platform. SaaS provides a fully managed service where everything is handled by the provider, and the organization simply uses the software via a web interface or API.
Cloud Service Example: Google BigQuery, Google Pub/Sub (for messaging services), Cloud Data Stream (for data streaming).
Cloud-Native Cloud Service Provider Services Used:
Cloud Service	Category	Description of Ownership
Google Compute Engine	IaaS	The organization manages the infrastructure (virtual machines, storage, etc.), while the cloud provider manages the hardware and the physical layer.
Cloud Storage	IaaS	The organization manages the data stored, while Google Cloud provides the storage infrastructure and scalability.
Cloud Pub/Sub	PaaS	The cloud provider manages the messaging infrastructure, while the organization owns and controls the data and events flowing through Pub/Sub.
Google App Engine	PaaS	The cloud provider manages the platform, while the organization owns the applications deployed.
Google Cloud Run	PaaS	The organization deploys containerized applications, while the provider handles the scaling and infrastructure.
Cloud Functions	PaaS	The organization writes and deploys event-driven code, while the provider handles the infrastructure and scaling.
BigQuery	SaaS	The cloud provider fully manages the data warehousing platform, while the organization owns the data stored in BigQuery.
Cloud Data Stream	SaaS	The cloud provider manages the data streaming service, while the organization owns the data streams and the resulting data.
Dataflow	PaaS	The cloud provider manages the data processing pipeline infrastructure, while the organization owns the data processed through the pipeline.
Dataproc	PaaS	The cloud provider manages the Hadoop/Spark cluster infrastructure, while the organization owns and controls the data processed.
Summary:
IaaS: The organization owns the assets at the infrastructure level, such as virtual machines and storage, while the cloud provider manages the physical infrastructure.
PaaS: The organization owns the application and data, but the cloud provider manages the platform and infrastructure.
SaaS: The cloud provider owns and manages the application and infrastructure, while the organization uses the software and owns the data.

The Centralized Data Platform (CDP) serves as a centralized hub for processing all business data originating from the HBD system. The data is stored in BigQuery, a fully-managed data warehouse service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This platform is meticulously designed to streamline data storage, integration, and accessibility, ensuring seamless interaction with other applications and systems across the organization.

The CDP is instrumental in processing diverse transactional and analytical data, performing complex calculations, and facilitating advanced analytics to derive actionable business insights. By leveraging GCP's robust services, the platform ensures scalability, reliability, and high-performance data processing to meet the organization's dynamic needs.

The CDP application is built and hosted entirely on GCP, taking advantage of its cloud-native capabilities such as Dataflow for real-time data pipelines, Cloud Storage for object storage, Pub/Sub for event-driven architecture, and Cloud Functions for lightweight processing tasks. The architecture supports just-in-time data access through APIs, enabling real-time data retrieval and consumption by downstream systems, including reporting and analytics solutions like Power BI.

In addition to these capabilities, the platform enforces stringent data governance policies, ensuring compliance, security, and accountability. Its design facilitates modular integration, allowing different data domains to contribute and consume data efficiently. The CDP plays a pivotal role in the organization's data-driven strategy, enabling faster decision-making, operational efficiency, and a solid foundation for advanced analytics and machine learning initiatives.

Just-in-Time (JIT) Data Access
Policies and controls to enforce secure, temporary access to CDP resources based on predefined roles, responsibilities, and time limitations.

Processing and Analytics Security
Best practices to secure data pipelines, transactional data processing, and analytical computations, with an emphasis on monitoring, logging, and role-based access controls.

Compliance and Governance
Frameworks to ensure adherence to organizational data governance policies and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, if applicable.

Audit and Monitoring
Implementation of robust logging and monitoring systems to track data access and processing activities, ensuring full traceability and accountability.
