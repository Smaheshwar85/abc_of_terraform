The Centralized Data Platform (CDP) serves as a centralized hub for processing all business data originating from the HBD system. The data is stored in BigQuery, a fully-managed data warehouse service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This platform is meticulously designed to streamline data storage, integration, and accessibility, ensuring seamless interaction with other applications and systems across the organization.

The CDP is instrumental in processing diverse transactional and analytical data, performing complex calculations, and facilitating advanced analytics to derive actionable business insights. By leveraging GCP's robust services, the platform ensures scalability, reliability, and high-performance data processing to meet the organization's dynamic needs.

The CDP application is built and hosted entirely on GCP, taking advantage of its cloud-native capabilities such as Dataflow for real-time data pipelines, Cloud Storage for object storage, Pub/Sub for event-driven architecture, and Cloud Functions for lightweight processing tasks. The architecture supports just-in-time data access through APIs, enabling real-time data retrieval and consumption by downstream systems, including reporting and analytics solutions like Power BI.

In addition to these capabilities, the platform enforces stringent data governance policies, ensuring compliance, security, and accountability. Its design facilitates modular integration, allowing different data domains to contribute and consume data efficiently. The CDP plays a pivotal role in the organization's data-driven strategy, enabling faster decision-making, operational efficiency, and a solid foundation for advanced analytics and machine learning initiatives.

This security document is intended to outline the security measures and practices necessary to safeguard the Centralized Data Platform (CDP) and its associated components, as described above. The CDP serves as a centralized hub for processing business data from the HBD system, leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as BigQuery for data warehousing, Pub/Sub for event-driven architectures, and Cloud Functions for lightweight processing. Given the critical role of the CDP in managing transactional and analytical data, ensuring secure data storage, processing, and accessibility is paramount.

The scope of this document encompasses the following aspects:

Data Integration Security
Security measures to protect data during its integration from the HBD system to the CDP, including secure APIs, encryption protocols, and identity authentication mechanisms.

Data Storage and Accessibility
Safeguards to ensure that data stored in BigQuery remains protected against unauthorized access, leveraging GCP's IAM (Identity and Access Management) and VPC Service Controls.

Just-in-Time (JIT) Data Access
Policies and controls to enforce secure, temporary access to CDP resources based on predefined roles, responsibilities, and time limitations.

Processing and Analytics Security
Best practices to secure data pipelines, transactional data processing, and analytical computations, with an emphasis on monitoring, logging, and role-based access controls.

Compliance and Governance
Frameworks to ensure adherence to organizational data governance policies and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, if applicable.

Audit and Monitoring
Implementation of robust logging and monitoring systems to track data access and processing activities, ensuring full traceability and accountability.

Incident Response
Procedures to detect, respond to, and mitigate potential security incidents affecting the CDP or its associated systems.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of security controls to address potential vulnerabilities, minimize risks, and maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the CDP. By adhering to these measures, the organization ensures that its data integration, storage, and processing capabilities remain resilient and compliant while enabling seamless collaboration across various applications and domains.
