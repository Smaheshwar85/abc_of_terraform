To organize your Terraform configuration into a production-ready structure, let's split the code into different files as requested. I'll create locals.tf, dev.tfvars, cloudrun.tf, pubsub.tf, iam.tf, variables.tf, and storage.tf.

locals.tf
This file contains local values that are commonly used across multiple resources.

hcl
Copy code
locals {
  name        = "your-bucket-name"  # Replace with your bucket name
  region      = "your-region"       # Replace with your desired region
  kms_key_name = "your-kms-key"     # Replace with your KMS key name

  pipeline_content = templatefile("${path.module}/files/pipeline.conf.tmpl", {
    project              = local.project,
    topic                = google_pubsub_topic.main.name,
    subscription         = google_pubsub_subscription.main.name,
    opensearch_password  = var.opensearch_password
  })
  
  pipeline_hash = sha256(local.pipeline_content)
  project       = data.google_project.main.id
  docker_image  = "your-docker-image"  # Replace with your Docker image
  memory        = 512  # Memory in MB
  labels        = { "env" = "production" }  # Customize labels as needed
}
dev.tfvars
This file contains the variables specific to your development environment. It is generally used to override defaults.

hcl
Copy code
name          = "your-dev-bucket-name"
region        = "your-dev-region"
kms_key_name  = "your-dev-kms-key"
docker_image  = "your-dev-docker-image"
opensearch_password = "your-opensearch-password"  # Sensitive value
cloudrun.tf

Summary
locals.tf: Contains reusable local values.
dev.tfvars: Holds environment-specific configurations.
cloudrun.tf: Defines Cloud Run resources.
pubsub.tf: Manages Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.
iam.tf: Configures IAM roles and permissions.
storage.tf: Defines GCS buckets and objects.
variables.tf: Holds sensitive and configurable variables.
Make sure to replace placeholders like "your-bucket-name", "your-region", "your-kms-key", and "your-docker-image" with actual values. This setup should be production-ready and organized.
