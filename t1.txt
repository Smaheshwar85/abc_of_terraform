Adding the Terraform configuration block you provided to the common main.tf file will introduce some changes to the workflow, especially if you're using Terraform Enterprise (TFE). Let's break down the workflow step by step:

Configuration Setup:
You add the Terraform configuration block to the main.tf file at the root level of your Terraform project, along with other common configurations.
Ensure your Terraform configurations are stored in a version control system (VCS) repository supported by TFE.
Workspace Creation (TFE):
Log in to your Terraform Enterprise instance and create a workspace for your project.
Link the workspace to your VCS repository.
Set up variables for your workspace, including environment-specific variables and any other required inputs.
When creating the workspace, TFE will automatically detect the main.tf file in your repository and use it as part of the configuration.
Queue a Plan (TFE) / Run terraform plan (Local):
In Terraform Enterprise, trigger a plan for your workspace. TFE will fetch the latest version of your Terraform configurations from your VCS repository, including the main.tf file, and execute a plan operation.
If running locally, navigate to your project directory and run terraform plan -var-file=path/to/environments/dev/logging.tfvars -var-file=path/to/environments/dev/gke.tfvars. Terraform will use the main.tf file in the root directory, along with other configuration files, to create the plan.
Review Plan (TFE) / Review Plan Output (Local):
In Terraform Enterprise, review the plan output in the TFE UI to ensure it reflects the desired changes and does not contain any unexpected modifications.
If running locally, review the plan output in your terminal.
Apply Changes (TFE) / Run terraform apply (Local):
In Terraform Enterprise, apply the changes through the TFE UI. TFE will execute the terraform apply operation, applying the changes to your infrastructure.
If running locally, execute terraform apply -var-file=path/to/environments/dev/logging.tfvars -var-file=path/to/environments/dev/gke.tfvars.
Review Output (TFE) / Monitor Output (Local):
In Terraform Enterprise, review the output of the apply operation in the TFE UI to ensure that the changes were applied successfully.
If running locally, monitor the output of the terraform apply command in your terminal.
Repeat for Other Environments:
Repeat steps 3 to 6 for other environments (e.g., prod) as needed.
By following this workflow, you can leverage the common main.tf file across your Terraform workspaces while using Terraform Enterprise or the Terraform CLI for managing your infrastructure deployments.
